   In this React testing tutorial, we are using React 16. That's why the Enzyme 
adapter for React 16 gets installed here. So make sure to check the React 
version in your application for installing the appropriate adapter. In the next step, 
we want to set up Enzyme with its adapter in our Jest testing environment. 

1. Enzyme in Jest Setup
    - npm install --save-dev enzyme

    - npm install --save-dev enzyme-adapter-react-16

2. Enzyme Unit/Integration Testing in React
     The Enzyme in Jest setup is up and running. Now you can start to test your React 
   component(s). The following section should show you a couple of basic patterns which 
   you can apply in your React component tests. If you follow these testing patterns, 
   you don't have to make a costly mental decision every time when you test a React component.
